## Don't You Froget About Me

Why are frogs so bad at data analysis?

Because they jump to conclusions.

```{r Video, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(vembedr)

```

This analysis was conducted using previously collected data on the California red-legged frog, which is California's largest native frog. It is listed as federally threatened, in a large part due to habitat loss and introduction of the invasive American Bullfrog (who's presence/absence was also recorded in this data set).

```{r Frogs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
frogs <- read_csv("Anderson_PLOS_data.csv")
frogs_filtered<-na.omit(frogs)
glimpse(frogs_filtered)
```

## Choosing My Data

![](images/OIP (1).jpg)

![*A photo of a road in the San Bernadino NF, one of the places you can find these frogs*](images/707179c534c63ca7ac592748bd3e6e4a-01.jpg)

I chose to use the distance from a paved road as the variable I weighed against California red-legged frog presence/absence. They also looked at a wide variety of other variables like distance from dirt roads and hiking trails as well as some vegetation, food and water variables.

```{r data frame, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
glimpse(frogs_filtered)
```

## Binomial Plotting

Here is the plot for my chosen variables.

```{r filtering, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(frogs_filtered, aes(PavedRoadDistance, CRLF)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"(link="logit"))) +
  labs(title="Presence/Absence of California Red-legged Frog)") +
  ylab ("Probability of Occurrence") +
  xlab ("Distance to Paved Road (m)")
```

My initial model looking at my chosen variables.

```{r Model, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_frog <- glm(CRLF ~ PavedRoadDistance, data=frogs_filtered, family=binomial)
model_frog
```

Here is my overdispersion check, like in our spider example. It looks a bit different, but I think most are still within the lines.

```{r check for overdispersion, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(arm)
x <- predict(model_frog)
y <- resid(model_frog)
binnedplot(x, y)
```

## Looking at the Model

```{r Frog model coefficients, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
coef(model_frog)
```

```{r Frog model confidence intervals, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
confint(model_frog)
```

The slope of distance variable is 0.002. After using the divide by 4 rule, the distance of 1 meter from a paved road corresponds to a increase in the probability of CRLF presence of 0.5% since 0.002/4 = 0.005. The scale of paved road distance is 0.005 to 0.001. m

```{r model summary, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
summary(model_frog)
```

In the model summary, the deviances are fairly similar, but there is no significant interaction between paved road distance and frog presence.

Fun Fact:

This is the frog that was referenced in Mark Twain's short story "The Celebrates Jumping Frog of Calavera's County"
