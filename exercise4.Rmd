## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Frogs, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
frogs <- read_csv("Anderson_PLOS_data.csv")
frogs_filtered<-na.omit(frogs)
glimpse(frogs_filtered)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r filtering, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(frogs_filtered, aes(PavedRoadDistance, CRLF)) +
  geom_point(size=3) +
  geom_smooth(method="glm", method.args=list(family="binomial"(link="logit"))) +
  labs(title="Presence/Absence of California Red-legged Frog)") +
  ylab ("Probability of Occurrence") +
  xlab ("Distance to Paved Road (m)")
```
```{r Model, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model_frog <- glm(CRLF ~ PavedRoadDistance, data=frogs_filtered, family=binomial)
model_frog
```
```{r check for overdispersion, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(arm)
x <- predict(model_frog)
y <- resid(model_frog)
binnedplot(x, y)
```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r Frog model coefficients}
coef(model_frog)
```

```{r Frog model confidence intervals}
confint(model_frog)
```
Interpret the slope of the logistic regression. Dividing the slope coefficient by four will give us an approximate estimate for the maximum predicted effect on the response of a unit change in the predictor. Slope of distance variable is 0.002.
\
\
In this case, a difference in 1 unit of distance from a paved road (m) corresponds to a increase in the probability of spider presence of 0.5% since 0.002/4 = 0.005. . Notice the scale of paved road distance; it is 0.005 to 0.001. m

```{r model summary}
summary(model_frog)
```
